# Angular utilities

## Introduction

This is a workspace intended for personal use and educational purpose.
I decided to start this project because I

- want to learn more about managing libraries and testing UI component
- was implementing really similar components/utility classes in different projects
- was finding solutions to certain problems and implementing them only in the most recent project
- customizing Angular Material can sometimes get really annoying and I wanted to compare alternatives
- more often then not you need wrapper with default values to reduce duplication and maintain flexibility
- tried Storybook before, but never really got to use

So, this project is the result of my attempt to create customizable and reusable composed/wrapper UI components with different UI libraries and other utility classes/services.

### UI component libraries

- Currently
  - Angular Material
- Potentially
  - PrimeNG
  - NG Bootstrap
  - NgZorro
  - Nebular
  - Taiga UI
